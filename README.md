Examples of adding javascript in Qualtrics
(Last Updated July 7, 2018)

1. Ego network Survey
The file documents a few features that I embedded in Qualtrics during the development of an ego network survey. Qualtrics provide very minimal guidance on how to properly embed Javascript on its platform. The following codes benefit substantially from related questions and solutions provided by users on StackOverflow. Thank you all.
Please be cautious that Qualtrics platform changes from time to time. And therefore the following codes may be outdated at the time you stuble onto this document. Use with care.
Hope it helps and Enjoy!
